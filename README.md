# CowboyBot

This is a pet project to make a fun and somewhat clean Discord bot for me and my friends' server. It offers native integration for the commands, various event handlers (such as checking new messages/users), and somewhat decent database stuff.

The bot uses DiscordPy and a SQLLite stack to function. The sqllite database is just a local file on my PC. Database operations are managed using [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/), an ORM library similar to .NET Entity Framework.

This is probably a decent starting point for your own discord bot, but I've slowly worked on this for a couple years so I may not remember exact specifics on if this will work out of the box. Follow the errors I guess.
