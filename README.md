# CowboyBot

This is a pet project to make a fun and somewhat clean Discord bot for me and my friends' server.

The bot uses DiscordPy 2.0 and a SQLLite stack to function.

The database stuff is pretty sloppy at the moment, but for creating a Discord bot that integrates with Discord's native UI (ex: slash commands, slash command input parameters) this should serve as a pretty decent starting point for anyone interested.
